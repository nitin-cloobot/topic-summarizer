# Documentation Workflow Manager

## Core Purpose
Intelligently route requests to the appropriate documentation file based on context and user needs.

## Documentation Files Available
- **Implementation.md** - Complete implementation plan, tech stack, stages, tasks
- **project_structure.md** - Folder structure, file organization, module hierarchy  
- **UI_UX_doc.md** - Design system, components, user flows, accessibility
- **Bug_Tracking.md** - Issue tracking, bug reports, resolution status

## Smart Routing Logic

### Use Implementation.md when:
- User asks about project planning, stages, or tasks
- Questions about tech stack or architecture decisions
- Need to understand project timeline or dependencies
- Planning development phases or milestones

### Use project_structure.md when:
- User asks about file organization or folder structure
- Questions about where to place new files or components
- Need to understand module hierarchy or dependencies
- Planning code organization or refactoring

### Use UI_UX_doc.md when:
- User asks about design, styling, or visual elements
- Questions about user interface components or layouts
- Need to understand design system or branding guidelines
- Planning UI/UX improvements or new features

### Use Bug_Tracking.md when:
- User reports bugs or issues
- Questions about known problems or fixes
- Need to track issue resolution status
- Planning bug fixes or quality improvements

## Workflow Rules
1. **Always read the relevant documentation file first** before responding
2. **Cross-reference between files** when the request spans multiple areas
3. **Update documentation** when providing new information or solutions
4. **Maintain consistency** across all documentation files
5. **Use context clues** to determine which file(s) are most relevant

## Quick Reference
- **Planning/Architecture** → Implementation.md
- **Code Organization** → project_structure.md  
- **Design/UI** → UI_UX_doc.md
- **Issues/Bugs** → Bug_Tracking.md
